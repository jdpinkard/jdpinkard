- 👋 Hi, I’m Justin Pinkard a novice programmer hoping to make this a full time hobby. I would say job, but I have too much fun to call it a job.
- 👀 I’m interested in drawing anime, playing video games, and of course, programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript at <a href="https://learnacademy.org/">LEARN Academy</a> full time and during my downtime I'm taking another look at Python 3 just for fun to see how it compares and if I can master it with what I've learned so far. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (Once I'm a little more practiced) something gaming related as I plan to make some simple websites featuring my guild and friends in FFXIV for practice and possibly a bot for discord using Python.
- 📫 How to reach me on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-pinkard-93a735114/">LinkedIn</a>.
